          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-4">The Original Comic</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            The iconic troll face originated from a 2008 comic by artist Matt Furie, known as &ldquo;Pepe the Frog.&rdquo; 
            However, the specific troll face that became an internet phenomenon was created by artist Carlos Ramirez 
            in 2008. The comic was originally meant to mock internet trolls - people who deliberately provoke 
            others online for their own amusement.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-4">Internet Culture Phenomenon</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            What started as a satirical comic quickly became one of the most recognizable memes on the internet. 
            The troll face, with its characteristic grin and raised eyebrows, became synonymous with trolling 
            behavior. Ironically, the very people the comic was mocking began using the image as their own 
            calling card, turning it into a symbol of internet culture itself.

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            In 2024, the troll face found new life in the world of cryptocurrency. $TROLL was born as a 
            tribute to this internet legend, representing not just a memecoin, but a celebration of the 
            chaotic, unpredictable nature of both internet culture and the crypto market. It&apos;s a token that 
            embraces the spirit of trolling - not to harm, but to challenge the status quo.
